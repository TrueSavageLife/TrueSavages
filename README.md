# COMMANDS:

+ /relog - to enable/disable the relogger
+ /duration <minutes> - to set the relog timer (default is 3 minute)
+ /beep - to enable/disable beep sound on enemy detection 
+ /death - disable log on death
+ /vitae - enable/disable client on >= 10% vit (defaults to enabled)
+ /pk - toggles pk targeting plugin (only works in fellows)

# PRO TIPS:

1. If you die and have >= 15% vitae, your client will close to prevent macro breaking. 
The /death command will disable this, use with caution. 

2. The pk plugin only works when you're in a fellowship with other people who have it enabled.
Press the HOME key to target pks.

3. If you have >= 10% vitae your account will log out unless you type /vitae to disable it.
